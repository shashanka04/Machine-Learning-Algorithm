->Linear Regression:

Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear connection and aims to find the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual values.


->Logistic Regression:

Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems. It models the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class and employs the logistic function to produce outputs between 0 and 1.

->k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):

kNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm for classification and regression. It classifies or predicts the target variable by considering the majority class or average value of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

->Support Vector Machines (SVM):

SVM is a powerful algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that maximally separates data points in a high-dimensional space, maximizing the margin between different classes.

->Decision Trees:

Decision trees recursively split data based on feature conditions to create a tree-like structure. Each leaf node represents a class or a value, making it a versatile algorithm for both classification and regression tasks.

->Random Forest:

Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions. It improves accuracy and reduces overfitting by averaging the results of individual trees.

->Naive Bayes:

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class label. It's commonly used for text classification, spam filtering, and other tasks where independence assumptions hold.


##EXAMPLES

Linear Regression:
Example: Predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

->Logistic Regression:
Example: Classifying emails as spam or not spam based on features like email content, sender, and subject.

->k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):
Example: Classifying fruits as either apples or oranges based on features like color and size.

->Support Vector Machines (SVM):
Example: Recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) using pixel intensity values as features.

->Decision Trees:
Example: Predicting whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on features like age, gender, and ticket class.

->Random Forest:
Example: Predicting whether a customer will buy a product based on various features such as age, income, and purchase history.

->Naive Bayes:
Example: Classifying news articles into categories (sports, politics, entertainment) based on the occurrence of words in the articles.
